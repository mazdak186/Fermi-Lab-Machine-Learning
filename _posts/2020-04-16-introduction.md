# Introduction
When faced with a business challenge that may require a machine learning solution, we must consider the following. What is the ML (machine learning) problem type? What are the data sources? How will the output be used? What metrics will deem the model successful? How will the finished model be properly implemented into the workflow? What are some possible non-ML solutions? These are some of the questions my collegues, Tisha, Chris, Mohammed, and I had to ask ourselves for our University of Illinois capstone project. We were tasked with exploring the first machine learning implementation at Fermi National Accelerator Labratory or Fermilab for short.
